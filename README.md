# Model Card for EMPLOYEE REVIEW MODEL

Employee satisfaction comes at the core of the success of every organization since these employees are what constitute the company and what drive it forward. Hence, ERA is a software solution that leverages sentiment analysis to give insights about employee satisfaction to help the companies' HR branches monitor, analyze, and improve their employees' workplaces to further enhance the company’s productivity.

# Model Details


## Model Description
This model leverages the power of RoBERTa, a robustly optimized transformer-based architecture, for sentiment analysis of employee reviews. The primary objective is to automatically analyze the sentiment expressed in written employee feedback, providing valuable insights into the overall sentiment of reviews.

# Uses
## Direct Use

The model is designed for direct use in sentiment analysis of written employee feedback without the need for fine-tuning or integration into a larger ecosystem/app.

Automatic Real-time Employee Feedback Gathering: As employees don’t want to keep filling out long and redundant questionnaires, traditional surveys are becoming outdated.  ML systems use efficient tools for real-time data collection.

Reliable Employee Feedback data: Ensure that the employees’ opinions are not affected by bias, resulting in accurate insights.

Continuous Improvement: By leveraging ML for feedback analysis, organizations can have a clear picture of the areas where they are lacking and can further refine their employee workplaces continuously based on the data analysis feedback graphs.


## Out-of-Scope Use

While the model is designed for sentiment analysis of employee reviews, there are certain use cases and scenarios for which it may not perform well. Out-of-scope uses include:

Financial Decision-Making: This model is not intended for making financial or business decisions solely based on sentiment analysis. Decisions involving significant financial implications should incorporate additional factors and expert judgment.

Legal Compliance: The model should not be solely relied upon for legal compliance decisions. It is not designed to provide guidance on legal matters or ensure compliance with employment laws and regulations.

High-Stakes HR Decisions: Critical HR decisions such as terminations or promotions should not be solely based on the model's sentiment analysis. Human judgment and comprehensive evaluation are essential in such cases.

Non-Workplace Sentiment Analysis: The model is tailored for employee reviews and may not generalize well to sentiment analysis in contexts unrelated to workplace feedback.


# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.


## Recommendations

To ensure responsible and ethical use of the Employee Review Model, the following recommendations are provided:

Human Oversight: Employ human oversight in decision-making processes influenced by the model's sentiment analysis. Human judgment is essential for understanding the broader context, addressing nuances, and making well-informed decisions.

Bias Awareness and Mitigation: Regularly assess and mitigate potential biases in the model's predictions, especially concerning protected classes, identity characteristics, and sensitive groups. Implement bias-aware evaluation metrics and address bias during model development and updates.

Continuous Model Monitoring: Implement a continuous monitoring system to track the model's performance over time. Regularly update the model to adapt to evolving language patterns and ensure its effectiveness in sentiment analysis.

# Training Data

The model is trained on the "Employees Reviews Dataset". For further information, refer to the following data card: kmrmanish/Employees_Reviews_Dataset.


# Metrics for business goal eval and baselines

Accuracy in Identifying Improvement Areas:
System's ability to accurately pinpoint areas in the organization that need improvement based on employee feedback.

Baseline: The existing accuracy rate at which current processes correctly identify areas needing improvement. This could be measured by looking at the number of identified areas that were later confirmed as needing improvement versus those that did not.

Employee Retention Rate:
Changes in employee retention rates over time, indicating the impact of ERA on employee satisfaction and retention.

Baseline: The average retention rate over the past few years can serve as the baseline. Any significant deviation from this rate post-ERA implementation can be attributed to the model's impact.

Employee Satisfaction Index (ESI):
A numerical representation of overall employee satisfaction derived from sentiment analysis.

Baseline: The initial ESI score serves as a benchmark. Post-implementation, changes in ESI can be compared against this baseline to assess the impact of the model.
